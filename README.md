Pressure and Level Sensors
Description
This pressure sensor measures up to 14,500 PSI with exceptional accuracy and impact resistance (industrial grade version). It’s ideal for monitoring oil, fuel, air, brake fluid (DOT3/DOT4), and water pressure. Compatible with most standard pressure sensor applications, it also integrates seamlessly with data loggers for reliable data storage.
